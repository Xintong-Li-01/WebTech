            Fostering pets has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life and is something I encourage everyone I know to do. But I’ve learned some big lessons along the way.            
            <br><br>For the experience to turn out well for the foster parent and the rescue organization (and, most of all, the dog), it’s crucial that all parties communicate and be clear about their expectations and responsibilities.
            <br><br>Here are some questions to ask the rescue group or shelter before you sign up to foster (the group will most likely have you fill out a foster-home application as well). Don’t be alarmed if the group doesn’t have answers to all the questions you ask. Each organization has its own procedures.
            <br><br><br><br><b>Questions about the dog:</b>
                <ol style="margin-left:5%">
                    <li>How did he come to be with the shelter or rescue group and how long has he been there?</li>
                    <li>Why does he need a foster home now?</li>
                    <li>Does he have any medical concerns or need medication?</li>
                    <li>Has he been neutered (or spayed, if the dog is female)? If not, when will he be?</li>
                    <li>Is he up to date on his vaccinations and has he been tested for diseases such as heartworm?</li>
                </ol>

        <p style="padding-top:0%;">
            <br><br><b>Questions about the fostering process:</b>
                <ol style="margin-left: 5%;">
                    <li>How long will I be expected to foster this dog? If it’s until a suitable home is found, how long do you expect that to take?</li>
                    <li>What happens if I can no longer care for the dog?</li>
                    <li>Who pays for medical bills if they arise? Does that include treatments for my pets if they catch something from my foster dog?</li>
                    <li>What should I do if there’s a medical emergency?</li>
                    <li>Who is responsible for communicating with potential adopters, screening them and introducing the dog to them?</li>
                </ol>
